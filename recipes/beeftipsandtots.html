		<h1>Beef Tips and Tots</h1>
		<img class="food"src="./img/beeftipsandtops.jpg" alt="beef tips and tops">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>I'm going to show you this very old-school method of making beef tips, which, once made, can be used to top lots of things—but my favorite thing to top with tips is probably Tater Tots®. And if you're looking for new ways to prepare lean, cheap, tough cuts of beef, this is one of my all-time favorite methods. You can give this an upgrade by topping with diced red onion, grated Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions, or you can serve the beef tips over hot mashed potatoes instead of tots, if you like.</p>
		<p>Based on my experience, "tips" are smaller trimmings cut from pieces of meat that weren't big enough to make larger chunks of "stew meat." Nowadays, beef tips can come from any cut, but for obvious financial reasons, your average truck stop is using something cheap, lean, and tough (so that's what I went with here). There's something very satisfying about making these types of cuts succulent and delicious. The keysare incorporating enough fat into the final product and cooking it long enough.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<div class="box">
			<ul>
				<li>1 ½ pounds beef round steak</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
				<li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
				<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
				<li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>2 ¼ cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
				<li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<div class="box">
			<ol>
				<li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller "tips." Season beef with salt and pepper.</li>
				<li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer. Let the meat sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, before turning over and browning the other side.</li>
				<li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything until the butter melts, and then stir in the flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
				<li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is starting to get tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
				<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
				<li>Uncover, turn heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, and the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
				<li>While meat simmers, bake potato nuggets in the preheated oven until crispy and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
				<li>Taste beef tips and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately over hot potato nuggets.</li>
			</ol>
