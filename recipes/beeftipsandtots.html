		<h1>Beef Tips and Tots</h1>
		<img src="./img/beeftipsandtops.jpg" alt="beef tips and tops">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>I'm going to show you this very old-school method of making beef tips, which, once made, can be used to top lots of things—but my favorite thing to top with tips is probably Tater Tots®. And if you're looking for new ways to prepare lean, cheap, tough cuts of beef, this is one of my all-time favorite methods. You can give this an upgrade by topping with diced red onion, grated Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions, or you can serve the beef tips over hot mashed potatoes instead of tots, if you like.</p>
		<p>Based on my experience, "tips" are smaller trimmings cut from pieces of meat that weren't big enough to make larger chunks of "stew meat." Nowadays, beef tips can come from any cut, but for obvious financial reasons, your average truck stop is using something cheap, lean, and tough (so that's what I went with here). There's something very satisfying about making these types of cuts succulent and delicious. The keysare incorporating enough fat into the final product and cooking it long enough.</p>
